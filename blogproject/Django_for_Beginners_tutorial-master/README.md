# About

To get an introduction to Django 2.0, I read William Vincent's [Django For Beginners](https://djangoforbeginners.com/) book.
 This repository contains the full code from the book, with my annotations and additions. The final product (covered in chapters 8 through 15, located in `/customuser/`) is a **very** simple online newspaper application.
